# Distance Estimation
Half of the targets in Arrowhead rounds are unmarked, which means the archer must estimate the shooting distance. The first step is to determine the size of the target face. For 20 cm and 40 cm faces this is easy: a 20 cm target has 12 faces on the butt, while a 40 cm target has 4 faces. The real challenge is identifying whether the target face is 60 cm or 80 cm.
You can use the size of the butt for orientation, but be careful: butts are not always the same size, and course setters sometimes use a “trick” — placing a 60 cm face (the smaller one) on a smaller butt, or vice versa, to mislead archers.

Once you determine the face size, you can identify the approximate distance range for the peg you are shooting from.
For example, the red peg for a 60 cm face is between 20 m and 35 m. Experienced archers also use the positions of the other peg colors.
In the same example (60 cm face), the blue peg can be between 15 m and 30 m.
If the two pegs happen to be placed very close together, the range automatically narrows to 20–30 m.

After narrowing the range, you fine-tune the estimation using one of several methods.
# Estimating “by eye”
In this method, the archer simply estimates the distance intuitively. It is the simplest and fastest approach, but also the least accurate, depending heavily on the archer’s skill and experience.
# Splitting the distance “in half”
Here, the archer visually divides the whole distance into two halves and then estimates only the nearer half.
This reduces the estimation error because evaluating shorter segments is easier.
# Laying down “meters”
This method is useful on short distances. The idea is to mentally “lay down” one-meter segments along the ground and count them until reaching the target.
# Thumb estimation
Thumb estimation is a traditional method and a predecessor of string-walking sighting techniques. The archer extends their arm and observes how much of the target is covered by the raised thumb.
The more the thumb covers, the farther the target is, and vice versa.
# Sighting – the forbidden fruit
Sighting is one of the more accurate methods of estimating target distance. The principle is based on Thales’ theorem of proportionality.

How does this help us?

Let

a = distance from the eye to the sighting reference (the “mark”),

b = width of the sighting reference,

C = distance to the target,

D = diameter of the target (or the proportional amount of the target covered by the mark).

If we assume that a, b, and D are constants, we can compute C from their ratio using
