# And Now for Something Completely Different

These pages were created with the intention of sharing knowledge and experience
gathered over many years of shooting Field — countless targets hit, even more missed,
and a fair number of twisted, broken, and lost arrows still quietly wandering
somewhere in the bushes. The content is intended for anyone who wants to improve
their knowledge, routine, and enjoyment of the sport.

The author reserves the right to be wrong — and accepts no responsibility for any
problems arising from the use of the information, advice, or calculations found here.
(Not even for those confidently claiming a target is “definitely 27 m,” only to find it was 33.)
