#Archer's Position in a Slope

When shooting up or down, it is crucial to bend at the hips, not at the waist or shoulders.
Your upper body should remain in a T-shape, regardless of the slope of the terrain.

Shooting up - correct position

When shooting up, maintain a stable T-position.
If you are standing in a flat stance, your upper body should always be straight.

Shooting down - correct position

When shooting down, make sure that the lower limb of the bow does not hit your leg.
Here too, we keep the letter T.

Incorrect positions – the letter Z

Incorrect body position leads to the so-called letter Z, which causes inaccurate shots and unstable technique.

Uneven Stands – Adjusting the Legs
Up

If the stand is uneven and you are shooting upwards, bend the leg that is closer to the target to maintain torso alignment.

Down

If the stand is uneven and you are shooting downwards, bend the leg that is further from the target.
At steeper inclines, you can even kneel with one leg for greater stability.
