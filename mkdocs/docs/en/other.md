# What to take with you on the trail

We go to the trail **well-shoeed**, preferably in high mountain boots.
We take with us **a backpack**, which can be converted into a stool if possible.
The proverb says: *"Better to sit badly than to stand well."*

To protect ourselves from various weather conditions, we take:

- **a hat** for strong sun,

- **an umbrella** or a light raincoat.

The backpack should not be missing:

- **a drink** (preferably water or an isotonic drink),

- **a snack** – today we have a whole range of energy bars available,

- **protection against ticks** (repellent),

- **a basic first aid kit** (bandages, gauze, disinfectant),

Since shooting can last several hours, it is good to be prepared for all conditions that may surprise us on the trail.
