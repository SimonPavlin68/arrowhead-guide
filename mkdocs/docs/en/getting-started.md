# Instead of an introduction

Arrowhead takes place on terrain, so most targets are shot off-horizontally. However, this type of shooting creates a problem because hits "shear" in height and direction. Therefore, the slope must be taken into account. For a successful shot, the following conditions must be met:

The archer's position must be the same as on the flat -> T-position.
The arrow must always be given the same "support" when shooting.
The body geometry must not be "knocked down", because then physics will let us down.

In short: When shooting up/down, try to "bend" at the hips, as low as possible, and in no case should we change the "geometry" of the shoulder girdle!
