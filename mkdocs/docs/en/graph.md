# The story of the oblique throw

When I started shooting Arrowhead, then called Hunter & Field, I always wondered how much to subtract or add on the sight if the target was not horizontal. There were arguments among archers, experiences exchanged... Then in the 1980s I got a photocopy of a graph.

*Swedish graph*

The Swedes made it. They brought a huge crane to the shooting range, then shot at different distances at different angles. They tried again and again. They drew it completely empirically - by trial and error, without any physical basis. I used this graph and I have to admit, it worked. But I kept wondering how to calculate it exactly. Since I am not unfamiliar with mathematics and physics, I set about the matter. My goal was to set up a measuring device at a certain distance and angle, as if I were shooting on a straight line.

I take a pencil and paper in my hands and after a few days I manage to solve the puzzle, I get the formula. I neglected air resistance, which would be compensated for anyway, since the length of the parabola changes slightly at different angles. The interesting thing is that the only thing that affects the calculation is the initial velocity and, of course, the acceleration of gravity. The latter is approximately 9.81 m/s2 in our country anyway. The derivation was quite a challenge, because a rather complex trigonometric function appeared in the formula, but I won't talk about that now.

Then, for the computer, program it and draw a graph. The drop-down menu presents graphs depending on the initial speed (v0).
Short explanation: the differently colored dots are where you need to add or subtract a meter, two, three ...

Of course, you have to keep in mind that you shoot like you would on a flat surface. That is, the upper body, shoulder girdle, arms in line, descent... The point is to bend at the hips. It's hard, but with some practice it's possible.

One thought: When the best climber of all time, Wolfgang Güllich, was asked which muscle is the most important in climbing. He answered: the head. This also applies to archery.
