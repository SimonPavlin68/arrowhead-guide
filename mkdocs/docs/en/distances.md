# Distances

Arrowhead competition usually involves shooting at 2x12 targets. The targets come in four different sizes, 20cm, 40cm, 60cm and 80cm in diameter. Competitors shoot at different distances, depending on their style and age. They are distinguished by the colours of the pegs: red, blue, yellow and white. Half of the distances are unknown, on these targets the distance must be estimated.
