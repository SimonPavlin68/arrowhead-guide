# Distance Estimation
Half of the targets in Arrowhead rounds are unmarked, which means the archer must estimate the shooting distance. The first step is to determine the size of the target face. For 20 cm and 40 cm faces this is easy: a 20 cm target has 12 faces on the butt, while a 40 cm target has 4 faces. The real challenge is identifying whether the target face is 60 cm or 80 cm.
You can use the size of the butt for orientation, but be careful: butts are not always the same size, and course setters sometimes use a “trick” — placing a 60 cm face (the smaller one) on a smaller butt, or vice versa, to mislead archers.

Once you determine the face size, you can identify the approximate distance range for the peg you are shooting from.
For example, the red peg for a 60 cm face is between 20 m and 35 m. Experienced archers also use the positions of the other peg colors.
In the same example (60 cm face), the blue peg can be between 15 m and 30 m.
If the two pegs happen to be placed very close together, the range automatically narrows to 20–30 m.

After narrowing the range, you fine-tune the estimation using one of several methods.
# Estimating “by eye”
In this method, the archer simply estimates the distance intuitively. It is the simplest and fastest approach, but also the least accurate, depending heavily on the archer’s skill and experience.
# Splitting the distance “in half”
Here, the archer visually divides the whole distance into two halves and then estimates only the nearer half.
This reduces the estimation error because evaluating shorter segments is easier.
# Laying down “meters”
This method is useful on short distances. The idea is to mentally “lay down” one-meter segments along the ground and count them until reaching the target.
# 10 Meter Technique
Learn to estimate the distance of 10 meters on different types of terrain.
Find a point on the terrain that is 10 meters away from you. Check how often this distance matches between you and the target. Add or subtract the remaining distance.
Remember: if you misjudge the first 10 meters, this misjudgement will be repeated every time.
# Owl Method
The owl method is especially useful if the terrain in front of the target is not clear (undulating, across a valley, across water, etc.).
This makes the other methods more or less useless.
First, estimate the distance to an object somewhere between you and the target (a branch, a tree, etc.).
Pay attention to how this object is aligned with the target or with any part of the target.
Move your head sideways and observe how the object moves relative to the target.
If it only moves a small distance, the distance between the object and the target will be relatively small.
If the object moves in line with the head movement, the object is halfway to the target,
but if the object moves more, the object is less than halfway to the target.
# "Addition" method
When shooting in a well-maintained forest (tree line) or along a fence, you can add up fixed distances. For example, the distances between fence posts, between trees in an avenue...
# Thumb estimation
Thumb estimation is a traditional method and a predecessor of string-walking sighting techniques. The archer extends their arm and observes how much of the target is covered by the raised thumb.
The more the thumb covers, the farther the target is, and vice versa.
# Sighting – the forbidden fruit
Sighting is one of the more accurate methods of estimating target distance. The principle is based on Thales’ theorem of proportionality.

How does this help us?

Let

a = distance from the eye to the sighting reference (the “mark”),

b = width of the sighting reference,

C = distance to the target,

D = diameter of the target (or the proportional amount of the target covered by the mark).

If we assume that a, b, and D are constants, we can compute C from their ratio using
