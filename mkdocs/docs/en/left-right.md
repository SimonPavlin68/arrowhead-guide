# Left - Right

When shooting on uneven terrain, arrows can sometimes fly slightly off-course – more to the left or right than expected.
Several factors affect this: from the light and the slope of the terrain to the shooter's position when shooting sideways on a slope.
Even when shooting up or down, we often do not shoot the same way as on a flat surface, which further affects the direction of the hit.

When the target is off-horizontal, our shooting position is usually not as level, leading to hits to the left or right.
